The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Whatup' Life Foundation. \n\nWhatup' Life Foundation is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason.

It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Whatup' Life Foundation app won’t work properly or at all.\n\nThe app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.\n\nGoogle Play Services\nGoogle Analytics for Firebase\nFirebase Crashlytics\n\nYou should be aware that there are certain things that Whatup' Life Foundation will not take responsibility for.

As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.

Whatup' Life Foundation accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.\n\n At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android & iOS – the requirements for both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Whatup' Life Foundation does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android & iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
